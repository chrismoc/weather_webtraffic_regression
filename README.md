# weather_webtraffic_regression
Goal is to make use of digital analytics traffic (session data) and to combine it with rudimentary weather data to perform machine learning algorithms. The chosen regression analysis approach will help to estimate website traffic for a given day with a given temperature and precib probability.

As this is just a play-around, downsides currenty are:
<ul>
<li>Only works for one location regarding weather data (whereas visitors can come from different locations)</li>
<li>Regression analysis doesn't perform very well so far</li>
<li>Approach to apply regression analysis and to evaluate model not very good as I don't have gathered enough data yet</li>
</ul>
